	abstract = {The physiological response of a cell to stimulation depends on its proteome configuration. Therefore, the abundance variation of regulatory proteins across unstimulated single cells can be associatively linked with their response to stimulation. Here we developed an approach that leverages this association across individual cells and nuclei to systematically identify potential regulators of biological processes, followed by targeted validation. Specifically, we applied this approach to identify regulators of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To this end, we quantified the proteomes of 3,412 individual nuclei, sampling the dynamic response to LPS treatment, and linking functional variability to proteomic variability. Minutes after the stimulation, the protein transport in individual nuclei correlated strongly with the abundance of known protein transport regulators, thus revealing the impact of natural protein variability on functional cellular response. We found that simple biophysical constraints, such as the quantity of nuclear pores, partially explain the variability in LPS-induced nucleocytoplasmic transport. Among the many proteins newly identified to be associated with the response, we selected 16 for targeted validation by knockdown. The knockdown phenotypes confirmed the inferences derived from natural protein and functional variation of single nuclei, thus demonstrating the potential of (sub-)single-cell proteomics to infer functional regulation. We expect this approach to generalize to broad applications and enhance the functional interpretability of single-cell omics data.Competing Interest StatementN.S. is a founding director and CEO of Parallel Squared Technology Institute, which is a nonprofit research institute.},

	abstract = "Reproducible research is the bedrock of experimental science. To
              enable the deployment of large-scale proteomics, we assess the
              reproducibility of mass spectrometry (MS) over time and across
              instruments and develop computational methods for improving
              quantitative accuracy. We perform 1560 data independent
              acquisition (DIA)-MS runs of eight samples containing known
              proportions of ovarian and prostate cancer tissue and yeast, or
              control HEK293T cells. Replicates are run on six mass
              spectrometers operating continuously with varying maintenance
              schedules over four months, interspersed with ~5000 other runs.
              We utilise negative controls and replicates to remove unwanted
              variation and enhance biological signal, outperforming existing
              methods. We also design a method for reducing missing values.
              Integrating these computational modules into a pipeline
              (ProNorM), we mitigate variation among instruments over time and
              accurately predict tissue proportions. We demonstrate how to
              improve the quantitative analysis of large-scale DIA-MS data,
              providing a pathway toward clinical proteomics.",
